    <div class="article-content">
      <p>It's 3 AM. There's a spreadsheet open with 100,000+ rows of customer data. My manager needs a "quick summary" by 8 AM. The panic is real. Then the clarity hits: nobody acts on a spreadsheet. I close the spreadsheet and open Tableau. I build one line chart showing a 40% spike in weekend sales versus weekdays. Five minutes in a meeting the next morning. The team shifts marketing budget to Saturdays. Revenue responds within three weeks.</p>

      <p>That night taught me something that no visualization tutorial had: the chart isn't the deliverable. The decision is. Every design choice — the chart type, the colour, the title, the number of axes — should be evaluated against one question: does this get the decision-maker to the right conclusion faster?</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        <p>"The best chart is the one that answers the business question fastest — not the most technically impressive one."</p>

      <h2 id="chart-selection">Choosing the Right Chart: A Field Guide</h2>
      <p>Before you pick a chart type, be explicit about what relationship you're trying to show. The most common mistake senior analysts make isn't choosing a bad chart — it's choosing the right chart for the wrong question. Get this clear first, then pick your visual.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparing values across categories</strong> → Horizontal bar chart. Clean, readable, alphabetically sortable, works with long labels.</li>
        <li><strong>Change over time</strong> → Line chart. The time-series workhorse. Use multiple lines cautiously — more than four and you'll need a legend, which slows reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlation between two continuous variables</strong> → Scatter plot. Add a trend line when the relationship matters more than individual points.</li>
        <li><strong>Intensity across two dimensions</strong> → Heatmap. Exceptional for time-of-day patterns, geographic density, and correlation matrices.</li>
        <li><strong>Part-to-whole for 2–3 categories</strong> → Pie chart, reluctantly. Beyond three segments: use a stacked bar. Beyond five: use a treemap.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution of a single variable</strong> → Histogram or violin plot. Box plots are underused — they pack median, quartiles, and outliers into a single glance.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <span class="callout-label">The chart selection test</span>
        <p>Before finalising any chart, cover the title and ask a colleague what they think it shows. If their answer doesn't match your intent, the chart isn't working.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="cafe-case">Case Study: How a Café Turned Its Numbers Around</h2>
      <p>A local café was losing money. Their only "dashboard" was a sticky note on the till reading: "Sales down. Help." The owner was convinced the problem was their pricing — they'd raised prices 8% the previous quarter and assumed that was the driver. It wasn't.</p>

      <p>We pulled three months of POS data and built a three-chart dashboard in an afternoon. The findings were immediate and unambiguous.</p>

      <p>A line chart showed a repeating dip at 3 PM every weekday — the dead hour between lunch and evening coffee. A heatmap showed Sunday afternoons nearly empty despite strong Saturday performance. A bar chart showed specialty drinks — the highest-margin items — outperforming food sales 3:1 in customer volume but barely featured in the seating area or staff recommendations.</p>

      <p>The interventions were obvious once the data was visible: a 3 PM happy hour on weekdays, Sunday afternoon live music to drive foot traffic, and retraining front-of-house staff to lead with specialty drink recommendations. Revenue increased 60% over eight weeks. Pricing had nothing to do with the problem or the solution.</p>

      <h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles That Actually Matter</h2>
      <p>Good data visualization design isn't about beauty — it's about removing everything that makes the answer harder to find. Three principles guide most of my design decisions:</p>

      <div class="num-callout">
        <span class="num">01</span>
        <div class="num-callout-body">
          <h4>Maximise the data-to-ink ratio</h4>
          <p>Remove every visual element that doesn't help the reader find the answer. Gridlines, 3D effects, background colours, decorative borders — if it doesn't add information, it adds noise. The classic test: if you removed it and nothing was lost, you should have removed it.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="num-callout">
        <span class="num">02</span>
        <div class="num-callout-body">
          <h4>Use direct labels instead of legends</h4>
          <p>A legend forces the reader to cross-reference between the chart and the key. Direct labelling — putting the series name next to the line or bar — removes that friction entirely. It's a small change that meaningfully speeds up reading time, especially for non-technical audiences.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="num-callout">
        <span class="num">03</span>
        <div class="num-callout-body">
          <h4>Use colour with deliberate meaning</h4>
          <p>In business contexts, colour conventions matter: red means bad, green means good, grey means background or context. Using red for positive values — even if aesthetically appealing — creates cognitive friction for your audience. Consistency with convention is worth more than originality here.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 id="python-viz">Python for Visualization: When Code Beats Drag-and-Drop</h2>
      <p>Tableau and Power BI are excellent for dashboards that stakeholders interact with. Python — specifically Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly — is better for exploratory analysis, reproducible reporting, and anything that requires conditional logic or programmatic data transformation as part of the visual.</p>

      <h2 id="common-mistakes">The Mistakes I See Most Often</h2>
      <p>After reviewing hundreds of dashboards and presentations, the same errors recur. Dual-axis charts that imply correlation between unrelated metrics (the most misleading chart type in regular use). Pie charts with 7+ segments and nearly-identical slices. Bar charts that don't start at zero, visually exaggerating differences. And the one that still costs organisations the most: predictive scores on dashboards built on unvalidated, poorly-documented source data. A confident-looking forecast built on bad inputs is worse than no forecast at all — it provides false certainty to decision-makers.</p>

      <div class="takeaways">
        <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Start from the question: "What decision does this visualization need to support in the next 15 seconds?"</li>
          <li>Match the chart type to the relationship you're communicating, not to what looks impressive.</li>
          <li>Heatmaps and line charts are underused for time-pattern analysis in operational contexts.</li>
          <li>Strip out everything that doesn't help the reader find the answer — maximise data, minimise ink.</li>
          <li>Predictive visuals on bad data are liabilities. Know your data quality before you add forecasting.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="tldr">
        <span class="tldr-label">TL;DR</span>
        <p>Data visualization reduces the distance between data and decisions. Pick your chart type based on the relationship you're communicating, design for the one thing your audience needs to act on, and always ask whether a non-technical reader could draw the right conclusion in 15 seconds.</p>
