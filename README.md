Data Insights Blog — Pharaoh Chirchir

"Numbers don't lie. But they rarely tell the full story."


About Me
I'm Pharaoh Chirchir, a Senior Data Analyst with over 8 years of experience turning messy, contested data into decisions that people actually trust and act on.
My journey started with a 50,000-row insurance claims sheet, mismatched date formats, and a stubborn refusal to admit I didn't know what I was doing. That humbling first week taught me more about analytical thinking than any course I'd ever taken. Since then I've worked across insurance, telecoms, retail, and financial services — building dashboards that drive real decisions, cleaning data pipelines that run reliably in production, and explaining complex findings to audiences ranging from operations teams to C-suite executives.
My toolkit spans SQL, Python, R, Power BI, Tableau, and machine learning — but the tools have always been secondary to the questions. The right question, asked clearly, is worth more than the most technically sophisticated model built on the wrong one.

Why I Blog
I blog because I spent years learning things the hard way that nobody had bothered to write down clearly.
There are thousands of tutorials that will teach you how to write a window function or build a dashboard. Far fewer will tell you why a JOIN silently inflated a client's revenue by 340% and nearly made it into a board presentation. Or what it actually feels like to watch a model with 87% accuracy fail completely in production because nobody thought about what the accuracy metric was actually measuring. Or why the most important thing I've ever learned in this profession has nothing to do with Python.
That's what this blog is for — the craft behind the code. The judgment calls, the failure stories, the mental models that don't show up in documentation. I write for analysts who are past the basics and want to go deeper: technically, strategically, and honestly.
Every post is written from direct experience. No filler, no generic advice, no recycled listicles. Just what I've actually learned, in the order I learned it, with enough context to be genuinely useful.
If something here saves you the hours I spent figuring it out the hard way — that's exactly why I wrote it.
